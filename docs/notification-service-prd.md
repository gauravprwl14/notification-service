# Notification Service PRD

## Product Overview
The Notification Service is a highly scalable, secure, and extensible platform designed for financial institutions to manage and deliver notifications across multiple applications and environments. The service provides SDKs for easy integration, supports multiple notification channels, and ensures secure payload handling with end-to-end encryption.

## Background and Strategic Fit
Financial institutions require a reliable, secure, and compliant notification system that can handle millions of notifications while maintaining strict data security standards. The Notification Service fits into the broader financial ecosystem by providing a standardized way to deliver transactional and operational notifications across various applications.

- Support regulatory compliance requirements for secure data handling

### Technical Goals
- Handle millions of notification requests per second
- Support multiple notification channels (push, email, SMS, etc.)
- Enable dynamic provider selection based on tenant configuration
- Ensure secure payload handling with client-side encryption
- Provide easy integration through language-specific SDKs

### Success Metrics
- Notification delivery latency < 500ms (P95)
- Infrastructure cost per million notifications
- Notification delivery success rate
- SDK adoption across applications
- System uptime and reliability (99.99% target)

### 3. Client-Side Encryption
Encrypt sensitive payload data before transmission over the network.

**Requirements:**

- Secure key management and rotation
- Lambda-side decryption for event processing

### 4. Provider Adapter System
Support multiple notification providers with a consistent interface.

**Requirements:**
- Abstract provider interface
- AWS SNS, SQS provider implementations
- Email provider adapter (future)
- SMS provider adapter (future)
- Dynamic provider selection based on event type and tenant configuration

### 5. Event Schema Registry
Maintain versioned schemas for event payloads.

**Requirements:**
- Schema definition and versioning
- Schema validation for events
- Support for schema evolution
- Sample payloads for documentation

### 6. Notification SDKs
Provide language-specific SDKs for easy integration.

**Requirements:**
- NestJS SDK with TypeScript support
- Node.js SDK for server applications
- Frontend SDK for web applications
- Client-side encryption in all SDKs

### 7. Authentication and Authorization
Secure API access with tenant-specific authentication.

**Requirements:**
- API key-based authentication
- JWT token support
- Tenant-specific authorization rules
- Rate limiting and throttling

### 8. Observability and Monitoring
Comprehensive monitoring and alerting system.

**Requirements:**
- OpenTelemetry integration
- Performance metrics collection
- Distributed tracing
- Error tracking and alerting
- Dashboard for notification insights

## Technical Architecture

### High-Level Components
1. **Notification Service**: Core service handling event ingestion and processing
2. **Client SDKs**: Language-specific SDKs with client-side encryption (focus on node jS SDK initially)
3. **Provider Adapters**: Adapters for different notification providers
4. **Lambda Processors**: Event processing functions for different notification types
5. **Redis Cache**: Caching layer for tenant configurations
6. **Config Service**: External service for tenant configuration management
7. **AWS Services**: SNS, SQS, Lambda, and KMS for notification delivery and security

### Data Flow
1. Client application sends encrypted notification via SDK
2. Notification Service validates and processes the event
3. Event is published to appropriate SNS topic
4. SNS delivers the event to subscribed SQS queues
5. Lambda functions are triggered by SQS messages
6. Lambda processes decrypt and handle the notifications

### Key Technical Decisions

#### NX Monorepo Structure
The codebase will be organized as an NX monorepo with clear separation of concerns between libraries and applications.

#### Client-Side Encryption
To avoid transmitting sensitive data in plain text, encryption will occur at the SDK level before transmission.

#### Redis Caching
Tenant configurations will be cached in Redis with pub/sub-based cache invalidation to reduce load on the config service.

#### SNS-SQS-Lambda Pattern
The notification delivery will use the SNS-SQS-Lambda pattern to allow for efficient fan-out and asynchronous processing.

#### Provider Adapter Pattern
Provider implementations will use the adapter pattern to allow for easy addition of new providers.

#### Terraform/CloudFormation Infrastructure
AWS resources will be managed using infrastructure as code with Terraform or CloudFormation templates.

### Docker
Ensure to use the docker file for each and every app and have a single docker compose file for different envs

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (8 weeks)
- Set up NX monorepo structure
- Implement core domain models and interfaces
- Create basic NestJS SDK with client-side encryption
- Implement AWS SNS provider adapter
- Set up basic tenant configuration management
- Create simple Lambda processor

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (6 weeks)
- Implement event schema registry
- Add Redis caching for tenant configurations
- Enhance authentication and authorization
- Develop Node.js and frontend SDKs
- Implement comprehensive observability

### Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities (6 weeks)
- Add support for additional provider types
- Enhance Lambda processors for different notification types
- Implement advanced error handling and recovery
- Add admin UI for configuration management
- Perform load testing and optimization

### Phase 4: Production Readiness (4 weeks)

- Final quality assurance and certification

## Operational Considerations

### Scaling Strategy
- Horizontal scaling of the Notification Service

- X-Ray tracing for end-to-end visibility
- PagerDuty integration for critical alerts
- Dashboard for notification volume and success rates

### Disaster Recovery
- Multi-region failover capability
- Regular data backup and recovery testing
- Fallback provider configuration for critical notifications
- SQS dead-letter queues for failed notifications

### Security Measures
- KMS for encryption key management
- IAM role-based access control
- VPC isolation for service components
- Regular security audits and reviews

## Integration Requirements

### Required Integrations
- **AWS KMS**: For encryption key management
